HPath
=====

This tool is a browser-based, user-extensible report generator for clinical
environments, as outlined in our recently accepted
[abstract](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1FiF-YZFOuURaMsRb71Baaw4WjKv19LZGtbrI9WMx7W8).

The tool is deployed as a web application composed entirely from static content
and served by [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/). Source code is located
in the [gh-pages](https://github.com/wilkinson/hpath/tree/gh-pages) branch.

Templates for the tool are completely decoupled from the application itself
and use a domain-specific language (DSL) based on JavaScript Object Notation
(JSON). Example templates, including the default template for hematopathology,
are available in the
[templates](https://github.com/wilkinson/hpath/tree/templates) branch.
